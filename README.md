# Matplotlib and Pyplot Project

**Student Name:** Elen Tesfai  
**Course:** Web Mining and Applied NLP (44-620)

This repository contains solutions to the tasks involving data visualization using **Matplotlib** and **pyplot**. The goal of this project is to demonstrate various ways to visualize data through Python, specifically using **matplotlib**'s capabilities.

You can find my project repository here:  
[GitHub Repository: my-matplotlib-project](https://github.com/Elen-tesfai/my-matplotlib-project)

## Tasks Overview

The tasks in the notebook involve visualizing various types of data using **Matplotlib**:

1. **Task 1:** Created a **bar plot** showing the frequency distribution of characters in a given text.
2. **Task 2:** Generated a sequence of **random numbers** and visualized them using **scatter** and **line plots**.
3. **Task 3:** Modified the style and color of the **scatter** and **line plots**.
4. **Task 4:** Plotted the **execution times** of **Insertion Sort** and **Merge Sort** algorithms to compare their performance with different list sizes.
5. **Task 5:** Compared two datasets using **subplots** – one **scatter plot** and one **line plot** – to visualize and compare their distributions.

## Rubric

Each question is worth two points: 

* **Data plotted** as described by the question (1 pt)
* **Plot contains required elements** (title, axis labels, axis titles, legend if required)

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/Elen-tesfai/my-matplotlib-project.git`
   
2. Install the necessary dependencies:  
   `pip install matplotlib`

3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `pyplot.ipynb` to see the visualizations.
